TravelMate AI ✈️
TravelMate AI 🌍 Next-Gen AI Travel Planner built with Streamlit

An intelligent, personalized, and visually immersive travel companion that harnesses the power of Generative AI. TravelMate AI provides a seamless interface for users to generate custom itineraries, visualize potential destinations, and identify landmarks—all within a clean web interface powered by Streamlit.

✨ Live Demo   |   📸 Preview

🚀 Key Features
AI Itinerary Planner: Generate detailed, day-by-day travel itineraries based on your budget, interests, and duration using models like Google Gemini.

Destination Visualizer (Text-to-Image): Unsure where to go? Describe your dream vacation vibe, and the AI will generate stunning previews of potential destinations.

Landmark Scout (Image-to-Text): Upload a photo of a monument or location, and the AI will identify it and provide historical context and travel tips.

Budget Estimator: Get real-time cost estimations for flights, hotels, and activities.

Interactive Chat Interface: specific travel queries (e.g., "What is the best time to visit Kyoto?") in a chat format.

Responsive Design: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers for planning on the go.

Secure API Handling: Uses Streamlit's secrets management to keep your API keys safe.

Here is a tailored README.md for TravelMate AI, following the exact structure and style of the Cortexa README you provided.

I have adapted the features and descriptions to fit a travel-focused AI application.
